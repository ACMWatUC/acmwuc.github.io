        <h2>NERDS</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> NERDS (Nurturing Educational Readiness and Development from the Start) 
        is a nonprofit organization that offers CPS students tutoring and after school programming. 
        This year, they are in need of student volunteers to tutor in their robotics program and 
        do general tutoring. The robotics program gives students from grades 4-7 experience with 
        EV3 Lego Mindstorm robotics and teaches them basic programming, team building and leadership 
        skills. However, many of the CPS students need help with general tutoring. There are also 
        other opportunities available for students with no robotics or coding experience including 
        volunteer coordinator and curriculum planning!</p>
        <p><b>Date:</b> Will be discussed at our first general body meeting on Sept. 3, 2020.
        Please keep an eye out for more information!</p>
