            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our purpose is to <b>increase the recruitment and retention of women in computing</b> at 
                the University of Cincinnati. The number of women in computer science and other 
                fields of computing is falling and we will strive to educate women throughout the 
                pipeline, girls in K-12, undergraduate and graduate students on the benefits of a 
                computing. The organization will aim to align with the universityâ€™s diversity campaign 
                and will serve as an outreach organization for current women and also, men in the 
                field of computing.</p>
